# Final Data Ouputs
This folder stores the final output datasets generated during the 'load_data()' phase of the ETL pipeline. These CSV files simulate production-ready tables that would normally be delivered to a data warehouse, BI tool, or reporting system. 

Files here reflect the completed end of the ETL workflow and are suitable for analytics and reporting.
