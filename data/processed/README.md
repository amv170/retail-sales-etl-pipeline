# Processed Data
This folder contains cleaned and transformed datasets procued by the ETL pipeline's 'transform_data()' step. 
Files have been standardized (data type validation, fixed missing values, joined tables, etc.) and are ready for downstream loading or further transformation. 

These files are the intermediate stage between raw input data and production-ready datasets.
